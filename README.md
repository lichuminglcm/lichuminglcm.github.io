Hi, I'm Chuming, a Phd candidate at School of Electrical and Information Engineering, the University of Sydney, Australia. Currently, I am supervised by Associate Prof. Wanli Ouyang. Prior to that, I was a PhD candidate at School of Computer Science in Tsinghua University and quited after my first year. I received my B.Eng. degree at UESTC in ChengDu, China.

My research focuses on RL and AutoML. Always welcome discussions and cooperations, feel free to drop me an email anytime you want.
